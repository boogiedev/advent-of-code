    --- Day 1: Report Repair ---

    Given an expense report (a list of integers), find the two entries that sum to 2020 and multiply both numbers together.

    Example:

    [1721, 979, 366, 299, 675, 1456]

    This expense report shows that 1721 (idx 0) and 299 (idx 3) sum up to 2020. The solution for this is 1721 * 299 -> 514579

day_1_ipt = [1721, 979, 366, 299, 675, 1456]
